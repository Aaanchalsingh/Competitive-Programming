. URL Hashing

Implement an algorithm to hash a URL as described.

Suppose the given url ur/ of length n is to be hashed with a string hash_string of length m. Given an integer k, run the ur/ through the following algorithm:

1. Divide the url into blocks of size k starting from the left. The last block can be smaller than k. For example, if url = "https://xyz.com" and k = 4, the blocks are ["http", "s://", "xyz.", "com"].

2. The values of the English characters 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' are 0, 1, ..., 25 respectively and that of ':', '/' and '.' are 26, 27, and 28 respectively. Thus the has value of the block "s://" will be 19 + 26+27+27= 98.

3. For each URL, find the hash value of each block. The hash value is the sum of the values of each character.

4. Replace the block with the (hash value of the block modulo myth character of the string hash_string.

Given the string url, hash_string, and an integer k, find the hashed string.

Example

Suppose url = "https://xyz.com", hash_string = "pqrst", and k = 4.
